            <h3>How this works</h3>
            <p>
                    This calculator estimates electricity cost required to mine 1 bitcoin. By assuming that the combined hashing power of
                the entire bitcoin network would produce 900 BTC/day (at current block reward of 6.25 BTC every 10 minutes block-time).
                We can estimate the energy cost required to produce the hash rate by multiply the network hash rate with machine
                efficiency and electricity cost required to mining the entire bitcoin network for 1 day. Finally by dividing the energy
                cost with amount of new bitcoin produce per day we can easily estimate the energy cost to mine 1 bitcoin.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus this calculator work by following formula
                Energy cost of 1 bitcoin = Network hash rate (TH/s) x Miner efficiency (W/TH) x Electricity price (USD/kW) x Mining time
                frame (1 day) / Amount of bitcoin produced (900 BTC/day)
            </p>
            <p>
                The miner efficiency and electricity price is left empty so you can input these value based on your available data
                because no one actually know the average efficiency of the machine currently mining the bitcoin network and the
                electricity price would varies depends on the location of the miner
